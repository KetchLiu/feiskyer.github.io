# Kubernetes 201

## 扩展应用

In the previously modules we created a Deployment, and then exposed it publicly via a Service . The Deployment created only one Pod for running our application. When traffic increases, we will need to scale the application to keep up with user demand.

Scaling is accomplished by changing the number of replicas in a Deployment

Scaling up a Deployment will ensure new Pods are created and scheduled to Nodes with available resources. Scaling down will reduce the number of Pods to the new desired state. Kubernetes also supports autoscaling of Pods, but it is outside of the scope of this tutorial. Scaling to zero is also possible, and it will terminate all Pods of the specified Deployment.

Running multiple instances of an application will require a way to distribute the traffic to all of them. Services have an integrated load-balancer that will distribute network traffic to all Pods of an exposed Deployment. Services will monitor continuously the running Pods using endpoints, to ensure the traffic is sent only to available Pods.

## 滚动升级

Users expect applications to be available all the time and developers are expected to deploy new versions of them several times a day. In Kubernetes this is done with rolling updates. Rolling updates allows Deployments to occur with zero downtime by incrementally updating Pods instances with new ones. The new Pods will be scheduled on Nodes with available resources.

In the previous module we scaled our application to run multiple instances. This is a requirement for performing updates without affecting application availability. By default, the maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during the update and the maximum number of new Pods that can be created, is one. Both options can be configured to either numbers or p
ercentages (of Pods). In Kubernetes, updates are versioned and any Deployment update can be reverted to a previously (stable) version.

Similar to application Scaling, If a Deployment is exposed publicly, the Service will load-balance the traffic only to available Pods during the update. An available Pod is an instance that is available to the users of the application.

Rolling updates allow the following actions:

Promote an application from one environment to another (via container image updates)
Rollback to previous versions
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery of applications with zero downtime
